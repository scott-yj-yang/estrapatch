# Terms of Use

*Last updated: February 25, 2026*

## Not a Medical Device

estrapatch is not a medical device, diagnostic tool, or clinical decision support system. It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Nothing in this application should be interpreted as a recommendation to start, stop, or change any medication or treatment plan.

## Informational Use Only

All estradiol level estimates are generated using pharmacokinetic models derived from published FDA clinical studies conducted on post-menopausal cisgender women. These estimates are approximations and may differ significantly from your actual serum levels due to individual physiology, application site, body composition, concurrent medications, and other factors.

Do not make decisions about hormone therapy, dosing, or scheduling based solely on this tool. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider.

## No Warranty

estrapatch is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. The developer makes no warranty that the application will be accurate, reliable, error-free, or uninterrupted.

## Assumption of Risk

You use estrapatch entirely at your own risk. The developer shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising from your use of or inability to use this application, including but not limited to damages for loss of health, data, or other intangible losses.

## Privacy and Data
